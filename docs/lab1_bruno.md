# Using Bruno/Postman to interact with CJDS :hammer_and_wrench:

CJDS is an API-first service, meaning that most of the configuration will be done via API using tools such as Postman and Bruno. For this lab, we prefer using Bruno as it doesn't require an account for you to import an API collection later in the lab. Also, all the instructions (including screenshots and gifs) were done using Bruno. 

???+ warning
    Bruno and Postman clients are installed in the laptop, do not use any web versions. 

???+ tip "WxCC Connector GIF"
    In this lab tenant, the Webex Contact Center connector for CJDS has been enabled. You DO NOT need to do it and your admin account doesn't have access. However, here's a video showing you how to do it for your learning:

## Lab 1.2 Configure Postman/Bruno to send APIs to CJDS

???+ webex "Instructions"  
    Open Bruno and you should see the collection that was exported during the Getting Started section of the lab. Now let’s change some of the collection settings:

    1. Click on the collection name "Wx1 JDS Collection" in the left panel and you will see the settings.  
    2. Click on the Variables tab and update the following fields, set the Initial and Current value to the same values described below:  
        - client_id – Set this to the Client ID for the Webex App you added earlier.  
        - client_secret – Set this to the Client Secret for the Webex App you added earlier.
        - org_id – This is an optional setting. 
        - workspaceId – This is the ID for your lab tenant: **67e2e90ec4b84e752570056c**

    4. Now click on the Authorization tab to the right of the Variables tab and scroll to the bottom of the screen.
    5. Click on the “Get Access Token” button.

    6. A Webex login window will pop up, enter the admin sandbox credentials that you used to create the Webex App integration.

            </figure>   
    7. Bruno will intercept the bearer Access Token and a Refresh Token from the CallbackURL you setup in the app integration, now you can use the token to send API calls to CJDS. Bruno will also manage the Access Token expiration by using the Refresh Token on your behalf.

## Lab 1.3 Sending API Calls to CJDS using Bruno
???+ webex "Instructions"
    Let’s test one of the API calls from the Bruno collection to confirm it works.

    1. Under the Wx1 JDS Collection on the left navigation pane, Click the green “GET” named “Get History Stream”. This will open the REST call in a tab on the right, Send the request by clicking the arrow icon and you should see in the response tab recent JDS events.

        ???+ info "GET History IMG"
            <figure markdown>
            ![Bruno Get History](./assets/get_history.png)
            </figure>
    2. If the previous step is successful, it confirms that the Bruno app is correctly configured to interact with CDJS. Now, let's update other variables in the Wx1 JDS Collection: 

        - The variables firstName, lastName and address information can be random. 
        - The phoneNumber and identity has to match the PSTN number you will use to call, make sure the + is included. 
        - The accountNumber is a random value you assign, it needs to be 8 digits long. **In order to avoid duplicates in the lab, don't use account numbers such as: 12345678, 11111111, 87654321, etc.**

            </figure> 
    3. Open the POST call named “JDS PageVisit” located on the left side under the Wx1 JDS Collection. Edit the Body of the call and change the identity to a **fake email account**, such as test-PODXX@test.com. Send the request and you should get a response stating that the data was “Accepted for processing”.

            ![Postman POST](./assets/JDS_PageVisit.png)
            </figure>
    4. Click on the “Get History Stream by identity” call and replace the identity with the fake email from the previous step. Send the request and you should see your new event in the JDS tape!

        ???+ info "GET History by Identity IMG"
