# Lab 0: Proactive Outbound Reach (Campaign Manager)

## Objective: 

Configure and execute a proactive outbound debt notification using Webex Contact Center Native Campaign Manager.

## Lab Summary: 
In this lab, participants implement the outbound entry point of the use case. A proactive voice campaign is created to notify customers when a debt maturity date is approaching. 

Participants will:
- Create a Debt Collection DB to be used
- Configure an outbound voice campaign using Native Campaign Manager.
- Define campaign parameters and upload a contact list derived from the Customer Debt DB.
- Configure retry logic for customers who do not answer the initial reminder.
- Associate the campaign with a specific Webex Contact Center flow designed for debt handling.

## Outcome: 
At the end of this lab, a proactive outbound call is successfully triggered and routed into the AI Agent flow, forming the entry point for the debt collection journey.
